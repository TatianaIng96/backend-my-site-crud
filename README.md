## Overview

This web application uses a REST API that allows to store data in a remote server for it to be used in CRUD operations. The application allows for users to store and update items and have them be stored remotely.

### Objective

- The main objective of this application is to store data in a remote database using Express.js as a framework. It creates a REST API for the CRUD operations.
- This application is deployed using the Render cloud application.

### Built with

- Express.js
- Git
- Render
- JavaScript

### Manual of Use

We are glad that you want to keep upgrading and developing this application. Below is an "instruction manual" to operate it correctly. Please refer to it when making any new changes:

- First, clone the repository by using ```$git clone (repository-link)```
- After that, in the terminal, please execute the  ```$npm i``` command to install the dependencies.
- We highly recommend installing nodemon with the command ```npm i -save nodemon```. This will allow you to execute real-time changes to the application.
- Execute the command ```nodemon ./src/index.js```. This will start the main file. The developing environment is now active.
  
- To test this application, you must have Postman installed. Please refer to the following link to start using it: (https://desarrolloweb.com/articulos/como-usar-postman-probar-api)

- The deployment of this application is made possible by Render. You can visit this link and follow the steps in the "Creating our Render app" section: (https://juanse.dev/blog/deploy-api-render)
